# funspace 0.2.1

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Increased the types of objects that can be handled; in addition to PCA, now PCoA, NMDS and TPDs objects are compatible with funspace.
* Simplified some aspects of plotting. Now, par() settings must be set by the user in advance. Thanks to this, plots can be easily modified by the user.
